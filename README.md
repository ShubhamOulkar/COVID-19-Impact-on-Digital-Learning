# COVID-19 Impact on Digital Learning (Sept.2021) 

# Problem Statement
The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among Americaâ€™s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.
